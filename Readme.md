This project is a data analysis of crime data for the City of Los Angeles collected from 2020 - Present. 

In this analysis I created:
- A map model to view where crimes are being committed throughout the different police sectors of Los Angeles.
- An analysis on the distribution of victims of crimes determined by age and gender.
- An analysis on the distribution of crime codes that are reported and their frequency of occurence. 
- An interactive feature that allows a user to find out how many of a specific crime was commited towards an individual of a certain race. 

All of the information is reported accurately from the database provided by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). 

This app was created using Python 3.10 within a Pipenv environment. The packages I used for this app were Streamlit, Pandas and Plotly. I created the app with functionality that would support updated data that is provided by the LAPD so that we are able to see how the statistics change in the future.
